This is a final project for the first quarter of MIT XPro's software development bootcamp. Containing most of the projects we covered; containing basics and advanced html, css, and Javascript within each project. You can Navagate through the website through the nav bar and on both the landing page as well as the project page. Have fun looking and exploring the different projects as well as a little history about myself. In the fututre i plan on adding more projects ontop of my resume to make this a more professional website to showcase my talents. Enjoy! Licence: MIT
